# MCP OpenAPI Tested Clients

This repository contains documentation on how to configure and test various MCP clients with the `mcp.openapi.com` server.

## Tested Clients

Currently, the following clients are tested and working with mcp.openapi.com:

- [Gemini CLI (English)](gemini-cli/README.md): Instructions for installing, configuring, and testing the Gemini CLI in English.
- [Gemini CLI (Italiano)](gemini-cli/README_IT.md): Istruzioni per l'installazione, la configurazione e il test del Gemini CLI in italiano.

Each client will have its own dedicated directory and corresponding `README.md` file and configurations files, which will be linked here.
